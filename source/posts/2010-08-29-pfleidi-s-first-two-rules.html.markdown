In the last few months, I've created two stupid, but funny rules:

1. “If you are able to construct a sentence which contains 5+ buzzwords, you are allowed to terminate it with 'BITCH!'”
2. Is related to [Godwins Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law "Godwins Law"). “As an online discussion grows longer, the probability that someone applies a 'yo momma joke' approaches one. Once this occurs, the discussion is over and the one who made the joke wins - but only if it was a really funny joke!”
